category: writing
difficulty: intermediate

prompt: |
  Create a LaTeX document that contains a professional flowchart using TikZ package. The flowchart should represent a typical software development workflow.
  
  1. **Flowchart Structure**:
     - Start/End nodes (rounded rectangles)
     - Process nodes (rectangles)
     - Decision nodes (diamonds)
     - Connector arrows with labels
     
  2. **Workflow Content** (Software Development Lifecycle):
     - Start: Project Initiation
     - Requirements Analysis (Process)
     - Design (Process)
     - Decision: Design Approved? (Decision)
     - Development (Process)
     - Testing (Process)
     - Decision: Tests Pass? (Decision)
     - Deployment (Process)
     - Maintenance (Process)
     - End: Project Complete
  
  3. **Technical Requirements**:
     - Use tikz package with positioning library
     - Proper node styling (colors, shapes)
     - Arrow styling with labels
     - Clean, professional appearance
     - Include document title and caption
  
  4. **Deliverable**:
     - Complete .tex file
     - Compile to PDF successfully
     - PDF file must be generated and viewable

evaluation:
  success_criteria:
    - TikZ code is syntactically correct

    - PDF compiles without errors
    - PDF output is readable and professional

  test_commands:
    - Compile with: pdflatex filename.tex
    - Verify PDF file is created
    - Open PDF to verify content renders correctly
    - Check that all workflow steps are visible
