  Use native command-line tools to collect comprehensive system information and save it to a file.
  
  1. **Required Information**:
     - Operating system name and version
     - Kernel version
     - System architecture (CPU type)
     - Total and available memory (RAM)
     - Disk space (total, used, available for each mounted filesystem)
     - CPU usage/count
     - Hostname
     - Current user
     - System uptime
     - Network interfaces and IP addresses
  
  2. **Tools to Use** (macOS):
     - `uname` for kernel info
     - `sysctl` for hardware info
     - `df` for disk space
     - `top` or `vm_stat` for memory
     - `hostname` for hostname
     - `whoami` for current user
     - `uptime` for system uptime
     - `ifconfig` or `ipconfig` for network
  
  3. **Output Requirements**:
     - Format output as a clean report
     - Use appropriate units (GB for disk/memory)
     - Save to system_info.txt
     - Include timestamp of when info was collected
  
  4. **Deliverable**:
     - A shell script or commands executed
     - system_info.txt file with all collected information

evaluation:
  success_criteria:
    - All 10 categories of system info collected
    - Output is properly formatted and readable

    - Timestamp is included
    - Commands execute without errors

  test_commands:
    - Execute the commands
    - Verify system_info.txt exists
    - Check that all required info is present
    - Verify format is clean and readable
